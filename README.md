- I created this program to visual what kind of gains I could see from the stock market, to make it
realistic, I have made the gains from (1.01% to 1.05% per week)

- Not only did I create a program that tracked positive progression, but I also created one that 
will track randomized progress between values of (0.98% to 1.05%)
